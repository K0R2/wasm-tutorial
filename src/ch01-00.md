# Basic Concepts

Wasm can be represented in both **binary format** and **textual format**. While a web browser load Wasm modules in binary format, textual format enable Wasm to be read and edited by humans. In this chapter, you'll learn the basic concepts of Wasm in textual format.

## Modules

The fundamental unit of code in Wasm is a module. A web browser load Wasm in modules.

```wasm
(module)
```
This is the simplest, shortest possible Wasm module.

This module is totally empty, but is still a valid module.

## Functions

While a web browser load Wasm in modules, it run Wasm in functions.

```wasm
(module
  (func (result i32)
    (i32.const 42)
  )
)
```

This module contains a single function that simply return a constant 42.

## Exported Functions

Not every function in the Wasm module can be invoked by a web browser. In order to be able to invoked by a web browser, a function must be explicitly exported.

```wasm
(module
  (func (export "answer") (result i32)
    (i32.const 42)
  )
)

(invoke "answer")
```

## Assertions

In this book, we use assertions to test our Wasm code.

```wasm
(module
  (func (export "answer") (result i32)
    (i32.const 42)
  )
)

(assert_return (invoke "answer") (i32.const 42))
```

The assertion in the last line assert that the `answer` function return a constant 42.

## Comments

A comment in Wasm can either be a line comment started with a double semicolon `;;` and extending to the end of the line, or a block comment enclosed in delimiters `(;` and `;)`. Block comments can be nested.
